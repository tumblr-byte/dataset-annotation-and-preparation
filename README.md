Dataset Annotation Samples – Object Detection, Instance Segmentation & Image Classification
This repository contains sample datasets I created using LabelImg and LabelMe, showcasing my dataset annotation and format conversion skills for computer vision tasks.

Contents
1. object_detection.zip
Annotations created using: LabelImg

Formats included:

YOLO format (.txt files in the labels/ folder)

Pascal VOC format (.xml files in the annotations/ folder)

I used LabelImg to annotate images and save them in both XML and YOLO formats.

I can also convert annotations from .xml (Pascal VOC) to .txt (YOLO) manually using custom scripts.

The file object_detection.mp4 is included in the repository as a demo video showing the annotation process using LabelImg.

2. instance_segmentation.zip
Annotations created using: LabelMe

Format included: .json files in LabelMe format

I can also convert these annotations into YOLO segmentation format using tools like labelme2yolo, based on project requirements.

3. Image Classification Support
I can create custom .csv files for image classification tasks with columns such as:

filename

label

folder_name

Or any structure needed for your specific task

Tools and Skills
LabelImg – Object detection annotation

LabelMe – Instance segmentation annotation

Manual annotation format conversion (e.g., XML → TXT, JSON → COCO, etc.)

YOLO dataset preparation for object detection and segmentation

CSV file generation for classification tasks

Why Hire Me
✅ Clean and organized annotations

✅ Support for multiple annotation formats (YOLO, Pascal VOC, JSON)

✅ Format conversions tailored to your target model or framework

✅ Demo videos available for reference and clarity

Demo Videos
The video object_detection.mp4 is included in this GitHub repository and demonstrates the annotation process using LabelImg.

Due to file size limitations, the instance segmentation demo video is not included here.
However, you can view both the object detection and instance segmentation demo videos on my Kaggle profile.

Feel free to visit my Kaggle page to watch the full demonstrations.
