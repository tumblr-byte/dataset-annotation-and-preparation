# Dataset Annotation Samples – Object Detection, Instance Segmentation & Image Classification

This repository showcases sample datasets I annotated using **LabelImg** and **LabelMe**, demonstrating my proficiency in dataset preparation, annotation, and format conversion for various computer vision tasks, including **YOLO** training.

## Contents

### 1. `object_detection.zip`
- **Annotation Tool**: LabelImg
- **Formats Provided**:
  - YOLO format (`labels/*.txt`)
  - Pascal VOC format (`annotations/*.xml`)
- **Details**:
  - Annotations were created using LabelImg and saved in both XML (Pascal VOC) and YOLO formats.
  - I can manually convert annotations from .xml (Pascal VOC) to .txt (YOLO) using custom scripts as well.
  - **Video Demo**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/hA3VoqOLGMY)

### 2. `instance_segmentation.zip`
- **Annotation Tool**: LabelMe
- **Format Provided**: LabelMe JSON (`*.json`)
- **Details**:
  - I can convert these annotations to YOLO segmentation format using `labelme2yolo.
  - Please visit my Kaggle profile to view a YOLO-formatted dataset created using labelme2yolo.
  - Another dataset, instance_segmentation.zip (Birds), contains additional samples for demonstration. Only a few samples are uploaded here due to file size limitations. You can find the full dataset on my Kaggle 
                    profile.
- **Video Demo**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/1BOiiCgOL0M)

### 3. `image_classification.csv`
- Demonstrates how I organize datasets for image classification tasks.
- **CSV Columns**:
  - `filename`
  - `label`
  - `folder` (e.g., `train`, `test`, `valid`)
- Custom CSV structures can be created based on project requirements.
